=== Dependencies

Most roles have a “soft dependency” described in their `requirements.yml` file.
These soft dependencies are used in the relevant CI Tests to prepare the machine for the execution of a given role.
// or test interoperability.
You can choose to use those roles if you like them.
Here is an overview of these soft dependencies:

=== Distributions

A role may work on different *distributions*, like Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL),
even though there is no test for this exact distribution.

consisting of all of my ansible roles.
It can be used in an all-repos configuration file as shown below:
